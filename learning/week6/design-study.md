# Design Pattern Change Study

Our group decided to go with food fashion. We were examining any kind of foods that people has been consuming throughout the years. And from this point, we can get the result on what kind of food that people do not consumed in the past, but it is popular now. For instance, it is surprising to see how everyone eats kale now, but 5 years ago no one had even heard about it. At this point we can help any agriculture companies in order to produce types of food that people will consume in the future. We first gather all the data from different agriculture companies or a statistics from the Department of Agriculture. We could also collect the data from the grocery stores, and including also the farm companies. In addition, we mentioned about gathering the data from different types of recipes from a websites, or any other social media. To analyze our data, we can gather the data and group by the healthiness of the food, or the ingredient within the food itself. At this point, we are trying to follow the data over time, and see what is the result. We thought that this analysis could be really helpful to farmers, and allow them to project demand for their corps in choosing what they want to plant in the future.
