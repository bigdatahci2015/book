Overview

Our team proposed to study change in fashion. Using the methods described in the paper, "Collect, Decompile, Extract, Stats, and Diff: Mining Design Pattern Changes in Android Apps", by Khalid Alharbi and Tom Yeh, we considered the changing trends of fashion and would like to study those trends. The following sections outline the phases of our proposed analysis.

Collect

The first step in our analysis involves collection of clothing data. From websites such asVogue. we chose this outlet because vogue has a data base of all the latest fashion shows going back to the 90s. This way we can see the trends in colors and even shapes of clothing.

Decompile

The decompile phase involves translating the data collected into a format from which the features can be easily extracted.

Extract

In the extract phase, the following features are extracted from the decompiled data.

designer
Color
Shape
Year
Location
Statistics

During the statistics phase, we will select features of interest and calculate the common trends in the clothing and popular colors depanding on time and place.

Diff

In the last step of our analysis, we consider how the number of units sold and average sales price change over time for the features of interest.
