# Report

As a class, we brainstormed and came up with a long list of further questions we can ask based
on the "self-introduction" data. Out of these questions, our team chose to tackle on
the following:

# How many students submitted personal information on or before the class deadline of 8/24/15?


# How many stuents have the term "computer" or "cs" in the description of the department or major?


# who has the user id 13950166?

# Who used their lastname as part of their github user ID?
