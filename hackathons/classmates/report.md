# Report

As a class, we brainstormed and came up with a long list of further questions we can ask based
on the "self-introduction" data. Out of these questions, our team chose to tackle on
the following:

# How many people submitted comments before the first class?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


# What percent of students are in the CS department?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


# Who has the oldest Github account?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}

# What is the most popular programming language?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}
