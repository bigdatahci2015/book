# Report

As a class, we brainstormed and came up with a long list of further questions we can ask based
on the "self-introduction" data. Out of these questions, our team chose to tackle on
the following:

# Who submitted by the deadline? (8/24/15)

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


# Who has a GitHub avatar?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


# How many people are CSCI majors?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}

# Who has this specific ID?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}
