# Method

The main question is too general and too vague. As a class, we brainstormed
and came up with a list of specific questions that are easier to tackle while useful
for making the decision.

From the class discussion, we wrote down five specific questions that are particularly interesting regarding the primary question: _What_ _is_ _popular_ _on_ _GitHub_.

* What activities/projects are the most popular on GitHub using site-specific statistics?
* What GitHub projects have the most community support in terms of number of contributing developers?
* What are the most popular programming languages on GitHub based on active repositories?
* What software developoment projects on GitHub are platform-independent?
* What are the available data analytics frameworks and work flow projects available on GitHub?

From the above list, my team chose a question, worked on it, and created a report on the next page.

#### Question chosen: 

_What_ _are_ _the_ _most_ _popular_ _programming_ _languages_ _on_ _GitHub_ _based_ _on_ _active_ _repositories?_
