The main question is too general and too vague. As a class, we brainstormed
and came up with a list of specific questions that are easier to tackle while useful
for making the decision.

From the class discussion, we wrote down five specific questions that are particularly interesting.

## Questions

*  What are the Web Application Framework that are most useful to build tinder like application?

* The languages in which programmer of that start up are comfortable with.

* Use the fork count on [Web Application Frameworks](https://github.com/showcases/web-application-frameworks?s=starskar) to determine the most popular web framework on Github.

* Use the Star rating on [Web Application Frameworks](https://github.com/showcases/web-application-frameworks?s=starskar) to determine the most popular web framework on Github.
* Based on the languages which of the  [Web Application Frameworks](https://github.com/showcases/web-application-frameworks?s=starskar) are most popular web framework on Github.


From the above list, my team based the rating on the fork count, worked on it, and created a report on the next page.
