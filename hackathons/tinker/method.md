# Method

The main question is too general and too vague. As a class, we brainstormed
and came up with a list of specific questions that are easier to tackle while useful
for making the decision.

From the class discussion, we wrote down five specific questions that are particularly interesting.

* What are the requirements of app?
* What do developers already know?
* How much time to develop?
* What platforms does the app need to run on?
* Who are your end users?
* What IS popular on github?

From the above list, my team chose a question, worked on it, and created a report on the next page.

(NOTE: But now that I see what's on the next page, I feel like we didn't really aim our 5 specific questions at the right thing.  What I think we needed to do is come up with questions that have data that we could find on the web. So here are some new questions:
* What web frameworks have the most downloads from github?
* What web frameowrks have the most questions and replies on stackoverflow?
* Both above questions but for just the past year or past 2 years
